      <h4>Our Story</h4>
      On June 24th of 2016, four General Assembly students envisioned a world where people and restaurants can have a more intimate relationship. These four students, otherwise known as m2The4th, set out to make this world a reality!
      Foodly was first conceived on June 26th, 2016 in a coffee shop called Simple Pleasures. We never went back… This application was originally made to target mobile users, and as so, was built on a “mobile-first” basis. </br></br>
      <i>“I don’t know what and where to eat”</i> ~ quoted by Everyone Ever</br></br>
      It seems like a common, every-day issue that can go through anyone’s mind and at anytime. Foodly’s here to help! Locate restaurants that are within your current area. See how other’s have rated this restaurant. Check out reviews from Yelp. More features are being added weekly! </br></br>
